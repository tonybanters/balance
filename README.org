* Balance

Project management that just works.

** Goal

Put Basecamp, Jira, and Teamwork out of business by building software that serves users—not marketing companies.

No telemetry. No AI. No side panels. No fluff. Just get your work done.

** Contributing

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch
3. Submit a PR

Keep it simple. If it doesn't help users get work done, it doesn't belong here.
